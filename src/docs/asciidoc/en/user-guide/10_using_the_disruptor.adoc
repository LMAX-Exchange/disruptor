== Introduction

The Disruptor is a library that provides a concurrent ring buffer data structure.
It is designed to provide a low-latency, high-throughput work queue in asynchronous event processing architectures.

To understand the benefits of the Disruptor we can compare it to something well understood and quite similar in purpose.
In the case of the Disruptor this would be Java's `BlockingQueue`.
Like a queue the purpose of the Disruptor is to move data (e.g. messages or events) between threads within the same process.
However, there are some key features that the Disruptor provides that distinguish it from a queue.
They are:

- Multicast events to consumers, with <<_consumer_dependency_graph,consumer dependency graph>>.
- <<_event_pre_allocation, Pre-allocate memory>> for events.
- <<_optionally_lock_free, Optionally lock-free>>.

=== Core Concepts

Before we can understand how the Disruptor works, it is worthwhile defining a number of terms that will be used throughout the documentation and the code.
For those with a DDD bent, think of this as the ubiquitous language of the Disruptor domain.

- **Ring Buffer**: The Ring Buffer is often considered the main aspect of the Disruptor.
However, from 3.0 onwards, the Ring Buffer is only responsible for the storing and updating of the data (``Event``s) that move through the Disruptor.
For some advanced use cases, it can even be completely replaced by the user.

- *Sequence*: The Disruptor uses ``Sequence``s as a means to identify where a particular component is up to.
Each consumer (Event Processor) maintains a `Sequence` as does the Disruptor itself.
The majority of the concurrent code relies on the movement of these Sequence values, hence the `Sequence` supports many of the current features of an `AtomicLong`.
In fact the only real difference between the two is that the `Sequence` contains additional functionality to prevent false sharing between ``Sequence``s and other values.

- *Sequencer*: The Sequencer is the real core of the Disruptor.
The two implementations (single producer, multi producer) of this interface implement all the concurrent algorithms for fast, correct passing of data between producers and consumers.

- *Sequence Barrier*: The Sequencer produces a Sequence Barrier that contains references to the main published `Sequence` from the Sequencer and the ``Sequence``s of any dependent consumer.
It contains the logic to determine if there are any events available for the consumer to process.

- *Wait Strategy*: The Wait Strategy determines how a consumer will wait for events to be placed into the Disruptor by a producer.
More details are available in the section about being optionally lock-free.

- *`Event`*: The unit of data passed from producer to consumer.
There is no specific code representation of the Event as it defined entirely by the user.

- *Event Processor*: The main event loop for handling events from the Disruptor and has ownership of consumer's Sequence.
There is a single representation called BatchEventProcessor that contains an efficient implementation of the event loop and will call back onto a used supplied implementation of the EventHandler interface.

- *Event Handler*: An interface that is implemented by the user and represents a consumer for the Disruptor.

- *Producer*: This is the user code that calls the Disruptor to enqueue ``Event``s.
This concept also has no representation in the code.

To put these elements into context, below is an example of how LMAX uses the Disruptor within its high performance core services, e.g. the exchange.

=== Multicast Events

This is the biggest behavioural difference between queues and the Disruptor.

When you have multiple consumers listening on the same Disruptor, it publishes all events to all consumers.
In contrast, a queue will only send a single event to a single consumer.
You can use this behaviour of the Disruptor when you need to independent multiple parallel operations on the same data.

.Example use-case
[example]
****
The canonical example from LMAX is where we have three operations:
- journalling (writing the input data to a persistent journal file);
- replication (sending the input data to another machine to ensure that there is a remote copy of the data);
- and business logic (the real processing work).

Looking at <<user-guide-models>> is possible to see that there are 3 ``EventHandler``s listening (`JournalConsumer`, `ReplicationConsumer` and `ApplicationConsumer`) to the Disruptor.
Each of these Event Handlers will receive *all* the messages available in the Disruptor (in the same order).
This allows for work for each of these consumers to operate in parallel.
****

[#_consumer_dependency_graph]
=== Consumer Dependency Graph

To support real world applications of the parallel processing behaviour it was necessary to support co-ordination between the consumers.
Referring back to the example described above, it is necessary to prevent the business logic consumer from making progress until the journalling and replication consumers have completed their tasks.
We call this concept "`gating`" (or, more correctly, the feature is a form of "`gating`").

"`Gating`" happens in two places:

- Firstly we need to ensure that the producers do not overrun consumers.
This is handled by adding the relevant consumers to the Disruptor by calling `RingBuffer.addGatingConsumers()`.

- Secondly, the case referred to previously is implemented by constructing a SequenceBarrier containing Sequences from the components that must complete their processing first.

Referring to <<user-guide-models>> there are 3 consumers listening for Events from the Ring Buffer.
There is a dependency graph in this example.

The ApplicationConsumer depends on the `JournalConsumer` and `ReplicationConsumer`.
This means that the `JournalConsumer` and `ReplicationConsumer` can run freely in parallel with each other.
The dependency relationship can be seen by the connection from the ``ApplicationConsumer``'s `SequenceBarrier` to the ``Sequence``s of the `JournalConsumer` and `ReplicationConsumer`.

It is also worth noting the relationship that the `Sequencer` has with the downstream consumers.
One of its roles is to ensure that publication does not wrap the Ring Buffer.
To do this none of the downstream consumer may have a `Sequence` that is lower than the Ring Buffer's `Sequence` less the size of the Ring Buffer.

However, by using the graph of dependencies an interesting optimisation can be made.
Because the ``ApplicationConsumer``'s Sequence is guaranteed to be less than or equal to that of the `JournalConsumer` and `ReplicationConsumer` (that is what that dependency relationship ensures) the `Sequencer` need only look at the Sequence of the `ApplicationConsumer`.
In a more general sense the `Sequencer` only needs to be aware of the ``Sequence``s of the consumers that are the leaf nodes in the dependency tree.

[#_event_pre_allocation]
=== Event Pre-allocation

One of the goals of the Disruptor is to enable use within a low latency environment.
Within low-latency systems it is necessary to reduce or remove memory allocations.
In Java-based system the purpose is to reduce the number stalls due to garbage collection footnote:low-latency[in low-latency C/C++ systems,heavy memory allocation is also problematic due to the contention that be placed on the memory allocator].

To support this the user is able to preallocate the storage required for the events within the Disruptor.
During construction and `EventFactory` is supplied by the user and will be called for each entry in the Disruptor's Ring Buffer.
When publishing new data to the Disruptor the API will allow the user to get hold of the constructed object so that they can call methods or update fields on that store object.
The Disruptor provides guarantees that these operations will be concurrency-safe as long as they are implemented correctly.

[#_optionally_lock_free]
=== Optionally Lock-free

Another key implementation detail pushed by the desire for low-latency is the extensive use of lock-free algorithms to implement the Disruptor.
All memory visibility and correctness guarantees are implemented using memory barriers and/or compare-and-swap operations.

[CAUTION]
--
There is only one use-case where an actual lock is required and that is within the `BlockingWaitStrategy`.

This is done solely for the purpose of using a *condition* so that a consuming thread can be parked while waiting for new events to arrive.
Many low-latency systems will use a busy-wait to avoid the jitter that can be incurred by using a *condition*; however, in number of system busy-wait operations can lead to significant degradation in performance, especially where the CPU resources are heavily constrained, e.g. web servers in virtualised-environments.

== Getting Started

=== Getting the Disruptor

The Disruptor jar file is available from https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.lmax/disruptor[Maven Central] and can be integrated into your dependency manager of choice from there.

=== Basic Produce and Consume

To get started with the Disruptor we are going to consider very simple and contrived example.
We will pass a single `long` value from a producer to a consumer, and the consumer will simply print out the value.

There are currently several styles of writing publishers and consumers for the Disruptor.
Whilst they are all fundamentally similar, there may be slight nuances in each approach that will be covered below.

Firstly we will define the `Event` that will carry the data and is common to all following examples:

.Example `LongEvent`
[source,java]
----
include::{gradle-rootdir}/src/examples/java/com/lmax/disruptor/examples/longevent/LongEvent.java[tag=example]
----

In order to allow the Disruptor to preallocate these events for us, we need to an `EventFactory` that will perform the construction.
This could be a method reference, such as `LongEvent::new` or an explicit implementation of the `EventFactory` interface:

.Example `LongEventFactory`
[source,java]
----
include::{gradle-rootdir}/src/examples/java/com/lmax/disruptor/examples/longevent/LongEventFactory.java[tag=example]
----

Once we have the event defined, we need to create a consumer that will handle these events.
As an example, we will create an `EventHandler` that will print the value out to the console.

.Example `LongEventHandler`
[source,java]
----
include::{gradle-rootdir}/src/examples/java/com/lmax/disruptor/examples/longevent/LongEventHandler.java[tag=example]
----

Finally, we will need a source for these events.
For simplicity, we will assume that the data is coming from some sort of I/O device, e.g. network or file in the form of a `ByteBuffer`.

==== Publishing

[[publishing-using-lambdas]]
===== Using Lambdas

Since version 3.0 of the Disruptor it has been possible to use a Lambda-style API to write publishers.
This is the preferred approach, as it encapsulates much of the complexity of the alternatives.

.Publishing events using lambdas
[source,java]
----
include::{gradle-rootdir}/src/examples/java/com/lmax/disruptor/examples/longevent/lambdas/LongEventMain.java[tag=example]
----
<1> Specify the size of the ring buffer, must be power of 2.
<2> Construct the Disruptor
<3> Connect the handler
<4> Start the Disruptor, starts all threads running
<5> Get the ring buffer from the Disruptor to be used for publishing.

[WARNING]
--
Notice that the lambda used for `publishEvent()` only refers to the parameters that are passed in.

If we were to instead write that code as:

.Example of a capturing lambda
[source,java]
----
ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.allocate(8);
for (long l = 0; true; l++)
{
    bb.putLong(0, l);
    ringBuffer.publishEvent((event, sequence) -> event.set(bb.getLong(0)));
    Thread.sleep(1000);
}
----

This would create a capturing lambda, meaning that it would need to instantiate an object to hold the `ByteBuffer bb` variable as it passes the lambda through to the `publishEvent()` call.
This will create additional (unnecessary) garbage, so the call that passes the argument through to the lambda should be preferred if low GC pressure is a requirement.
--

Given that method references can be used instead of anonymous lambdas, it is possible to rewrite the example in this fashion:

.Example using method references
[source,java]
----
include::{gradle-rootdir}/src/examples/java/com/lmax/disruptor/examples/longevent/methodrefs/LongEventMain.java[tag=example]
----

===== Using Translators

Prior to version 3.0, the preferred way of publishing messages was via the Event Publisher/Event Translator interfaces:

.Example `LongEventProducer`
[source,java]
----
include::{gradle-rootdir}/src/examples/java/com/lmax/disruptor/examples/longevent/LongEventProducer.java[tag=example]
----

This approach uses number of extra classes (e.g. handler, translator) that are not explicitly required when using lambdas.
The advantage of here is that the translator code can be pulled into a separate class and easily unit tested.

The Disruptor provides a number of different interfaces (`EventTranslator`, `EventTranslatorOneArg`, `EventTranslatorTwoArg`, etc.) that can be implemented to provide translators.
This is to allow for the translators to be represented as static classes and lambdas (see <<publishing-using-lambdas,above>>).
The arguments to the translation method are passed through the call on the Ring Buffer through to the translator.

==== Publishing Using the Legacy API

There is a more "raw" approach that we can use:

.Example Legacy `LongEventProducer`
[source,java]
----
include::{gradle-rootdir}/src/examples/java/com/lmax/disruptor/examples/longevent/legacy/LongEventProducer.java[tag=example]
----
<1> Grab the next sequence
<2> Get the entry in the Disruptor for that sequence
<3> Fill the entry with data

What becomes immediately obvious is that event publication becomes more involved than using a simple queue.
This is due to the desire for Event pre-allocation.
It requires (at the lowest level) a 2-phase approach to message publication, i.e. claim the slot in the ring buffer and then publish the available data.

[CAUTION]
--
It is also necessary to wrap publication in a `try`/`finally` block.

If we claim a slot in the Ring Buffer (calling ``RingBuffer#next()``) then we must publish this sequence.
Failing to do so can result in corruption of the state of the Disruptor.

Specifically, in the multi-producer case, this will result in the consumers stalling and being unable to recover without a restart.
Therefore, it is recommended that either the lambda or `EventTranslator` APIs be used.
--

The final step is to wire the whole thing together.
Whilst it is possible to wire up each component manually, this can be complicated and so a DSL is provided to simplify construction.

TIP: Some of the more complicated options are not available via the DSL; however, it is suitable for most circumstances.

----

=== Basic Tuning Options

Using the above approach will work functionally in the widest set of deployment scenarios.
However, there are a number of tuning options that can be used to improve performance.

The two main options for tuning are:

- <<_single_vs_multiple_producers, Single vs. multiple producers>>, _and_
- <<_alternative_wait_strategies, Alternative wait strategies>>.

Both of these options are set when constructing a Disruptor:

.Tuning the Disruptor
[source,java]
----
public class LongEventMain
{
    public static void main(final String[] args)
    {
        //.....
        Disruptor<LongEvent> disruptor = new Disruptor(
            factory,
            bufferSize,
            DaemonThreadFactory.INSTANCE,
            ProducerType.SINGLE, // <1>
            new BlockingWaitStrategy() // <2>
        );
        //.....
    }
}
----
<1> Use `ProducerType#SINGLE` to create a `SingleProducerSequencer`; use `ProducerType#MULTI` to create a `MultiProducerSequence`
<2> Set the desired `WaitStrategy`


[#_single_vs_multiple_producers]
==== Single vs. Multiple Producers

One of the best ways to improve performance in concurrent systems is to adhere to the https://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/09/single-writer-principle.html[Single Writer Principle], this applies to the Disruptor.
If you are in the situation where there will only ever be a single thread producing events into the Disruptor, then you can take advantage of this to gain additional performance.

To give an indication of how much of a performance advantage can be achieved through this technique we can change the producer type in the OneToOne performance test.
Tests run on i7 Sandy Bridge MacBook Air.

[#_alternative_wait_strategies]
==== Alternative Wait Strategies

The default `WaitStrategy` used by the Disruptor is the `BlockingWaitStrategy`.
Internally the `BlockingWaitStrategy` uses a typical lock and condition variable to handle thread wake-up.
The `BlockingWaitStrategy` is the slowest of the available wait strategies, but is the most conservative with the respect to CPU usage and will give the most consistent behaviour across the widest variety of deployment options.

Knowledge of the deployed system can allow for additional performance by choosing a more appropriate wait strategy:

- **SleepingWaitStrategy** ->

--
Like the `BlockingWaitStrategy` the `SleepingWaitStrategy` it attempts to be conservative with CPU usage by using a simple busy wait loop.
The difference is that the `SleepingWaitStrategy` uses a call to link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/LockSupport.html#parkNanos(long)[`LockSupport.parkNanos(1)`^] in the middle of the loop.
On a typical Linux system this will pause the thread for around 60µs.

This has the benefits that the producing thread does not need to take any action other increment the appropriate counter and that it does not require the cost of signalling a condition variable.
However, the mean latency of moving the event between the producer and consumer threads will be higher.

It works best in situations where low latency is not required, but a low impact on the producing thread is desired.
A common use case is for asynchronous logging.
--

- **YieldingWaitStrategy** ->

--
The `YieldingWaitStrategy` is one of two ``WaitStrategy``s that can be use in low-latency systems.
It is designed for cases where there is the option to burn CPU cycles with the goal of improving latency.

The `YieldingWaitStrategy` will busy spin, waiting for the sequence to increment to the appropriate value.
Inside the body of the loop `Thread#yield()` will be called allowing other queued threads to run.

This is the recommended wait strategy when you need very high performance, and the number of `EventHandler` threads is lower than the total number of logical cores, e.g. you have hyper-threading enabled.
--

- **BusySpinWaitStrategy** ->

--
The `BusySpinWaitStrategy` is the highest performing `WaitStrategy`.
Like the `YieldingWaitStrategy`, it can be used in low-latency systems, but puts the highest constraints on the deployment environment.

This wait strategy should only be used if the number of `EventHandler` threads is lower than the number of physical cores on the box, e.g. hyper-threading should be disabled.
--

=== Clearing Objects From the Ring Buffer

When passing data via the Disruptor, it is possible for objects to live longer than intended.
To avoid this happening it may be necessary to clear out the event after processing it.

If you have a single event handler, clearing out the value within the same handler is sufficient.
If you have a chain of event handlers, then you may need a specific handler placed at the end of the chain to handle clearing out the object.
