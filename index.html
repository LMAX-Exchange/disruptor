          <h2>Read This First</h2>

          <p>To understand the problem the Disruptor is trying to solve, and to get a feel for why this concurrency framework is so fast, read the 
            <a href="http://lmax-exchange.github.com/disruptor/files/Disruptor-1.0.pdf">Technical Paper</a>.  It also contains detailed performance results.</p>

            <p>And now for some words from our sponsors... LMAX are recruiting once again.  If you are interested in working with a great team, with some amazing technology, and think you can add something to the mix then please check out our <a href="http://www.lmax.com/careers">jobs page</a>.</p>

            <h2>What is the Disruptor?</h2>

            <p><a href="http://www.lmax.com">LMAX</a> aims to be the fastest trading platform in the world.  Clearly, in order to achieve this we needed to do something special to achieve very low-latency and high-throughput with our Java platform. Performance testing showed that using queues to pass data between stages of the system was introducing latency, so we focused on optimising this area.</p>

            <p>The Disruptor is the result of our research and testing.  We found that cache misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both extremely costly, so we created a framework which has "mechanical sympathy" for the hardware it's running on, and that's lock-free.</p>

            <p>This is not a specialist solution, it's not designed to work only for a financial application.  The Disruptor is a general-purpose mechanism for solving a difficult problem in concurrent programming.</p>

            <p>It works in a different way to more conventional approaches, so you use it a little differently than you might be used to.  For example, applying the pattern to your system is not as simple as replacing all your queues with the <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-whats-so-special.html">magic ring buffer</a>.  We've got <a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki/Code-Example-Disruptor2x">code samples</a> to guide you, a growing number of <a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki/Blogs-And-Articles">blogs and articles</a> giving an overview of how it works, the <a href="http://disruptor.googlecode.com/files/Disruptor-1.0.pdf">technical paper</a> goes into some detail as you'd expect, and the performance tests give examples of how to use the Disruptor:</p>

            <p>If you prefer real, live people explaining things instead of a dry paper or content-heavy website, there's always the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX">presentation Mike and Martin gave</a> at QCon San Francisco.  If you fancy a natter with the folks involved head over to our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/lmax-disruptor">Discussion Group</a>. Martin will also witter on occasionally about performance in his <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/">Mechanical Sympathy</a> blog.  Martin Fowler has also done a great <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html">review</a> of the Disruptor's application at LMAX.</p>

            <h2>What's the big deal?</h2>

            <p>It's fast.  Very fast.</p>

            <p><img src="http://lmax-exchange.github.com/disruptor/images/latency-histogram.png"/></p>

            <p>Note that this is a log-log scale, not linear.  If we tried to plot the comparisons on a linear scale, we'd run out of space very quickly.  We have <a href="https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki/Performance-Results">performance results</a> of the test that produced these results, plus others of throughput testing.</p>
